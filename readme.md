Hello.
Setup+Installation Guide:
Clone repo on your system from Github.
There are 2 folders for both BE and FE.
The Mongo DB has been hosted online so you dont need to setup that on your local machine. The credentials have been directly added in code.

Setup of BE:
after opening root folder, open a terminal pointing to the root folder.
Run the following commands:
1) cd ./Backend
2) npm i

Now after this is done, you can start the backend server with the command: "node index.js"

After starting Backend, lets move to frontend. Now for installation, again create a new seperate terminal pointing to the root folder. 
Run the following commands:
1) cd ./frontendreact/
2) npm i

Now after this is done, you can start the frontend using the following command:
"npm run start"

Please Note: Run Frontend only after Backend code is up and running.

PS: The desiging of Frontend is not given focus as it can be subjective. To see my Frontend style, can discuss that over call.
